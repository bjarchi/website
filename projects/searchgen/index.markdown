title: SearchGen
---

SearchGen is a script for generating a trie in C. I wrote it as an
experiment to see how a bytecode based matcher (like those used by
many regular expression engines) and the same logic written in native
assembly would compare.

The obvious difference is that for the bytecode system, there is a
small amount of code used to interpret it, while my system has a
larger code footprint and thus may cause cache pressure in the
instruction cache. Also, an interpreter may get better branch
prediction behaviour because of the tight loop, where mine probably
sufferes from many mispredictions. If someone has access to a copy of
the Intel vTune performance analysis tools, Iâ€™d be interested in the
results.

### Usage

Download the source [here](/~reillyeon/files/searchgen-0.1.tar.gz) and
unpack the tarball. The file <code>build.py</code> is the main
program. The files <code>main.c</code> and <code>main-len.c</code> are
example programs. The <code>Makefile</code> is a good example of how
to build using the script. The <code>words</code> file is used as a
test case.

When given a dictionary the script generates a header file which
defines a single <code>match</code> function. There are two
modes. When given the <code>--length</code> option the match function
expects the length of the input string to be given as an
argument. Otherwise it expects the string to be null
terminated. Depending on the dictionary, one may be more efficient
than the other.

The match function returns the index into the supplied dictionary file
of the word that was found, or -1 if there was no match.
