The Filesystem Interface to Git (known by the acronym "figfs",
pronounced like "figs") allows developers to work with a project in a
Git repository just like a local filesystem. This means that all the
branchs, tags, and revisions are available for browsing without having
to check anything out. This is great for browsing project histories
because you can have your editor pointed at two different versions at
once and can use all your normal tools like diff to compare things.

In addition, figfs has the ability to create a "workspace" in which
the contents of the repository at a particular revision can be freely
edited.
